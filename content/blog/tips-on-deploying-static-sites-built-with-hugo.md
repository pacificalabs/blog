### Background
[Hugo](www.gohugo.com) is a superfast framework built in Googles own language Go. 

When reviewing a static site generator our team were frustrated with the slow build time of Jekyll. 

The motto of Hugo is build sites lightning fast & the build time doesn't disappoint.

*Deploying Hugo is not at all straightforward & the options on the Hugo website don't really offer anything that's fast to setup & user friendly to maintain. Below some considerations when choosing a static site....*  

### Assumptions & Prerequisites
1. You have Hugo installed & you're ready to publish your site online.
2. You have initialized your root folder with git & have made a number of commitments.

### Steps:

1. Ensure your rootURl located in the config file (file extension will be either YAML or TOML) has " " & not a url.
```bash
# config.yaml
title: "Pacifica Labs"
baseURL: ""  # note the absence of any url
languageCode: "en-AU"
```
   
1a. *Start by building your static site*
  
```bash
$ hugo
Start building sites â€¦

 2a) You will have content in the public folder

```sh
$ ls public/

404.html
about
articles
blog
docs
favicon.ico
fonts
gallery
index.html
(...)
(...)
(...)
(etc)

```

2b. Create an empty repository on github, setup pages & install a README

3a. Copy the git URL for the repository

``` 
$ git submodule add URL public/
(repository is cloned)

```
3b. cd into the public folder , commit the changes and deploy

4a. cd into the root folder, commit these changes as well

5a you should be able to see commit at github

** Here ** is a bash script I have written to automate the deployment process.



#### ***Appendix***

1. The [top 4](https://jamstack.org/generators/) global static site generators were Next.js, Hugo & Gatsby & Jekyll. 
2. In benchmarking tests Hugo compiled [23x](https://forestry.io/blog/hugo-vs-jekyll-benchmark/#tl-dr) faster than Jekyll.
