For any software engineer of note, your time is always at a premium, so the ability to quickly & efficiently navigate your way around the terminal will boost your productivity no end.


```bash
ctrl + A
#go to the START of the current line
ctrl + E
#go to the END of the current line
ctrl + L
#clear the screen
ctrl + U
#clear the line BEFORE the cursor position
ctrl + K
#clear the line AFTER the cursor position
#NB If you are at the end of the line the entire line is cleared
alt + F

alt + B
#move backwards one word position
